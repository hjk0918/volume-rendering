    \caption{\textbf{NeRF-RPN.} Our \nerfrpn first samples a grid of points and extract their RGB and density in NeRF. The extracted volumetric features are then passed through a 3D backbone architecture to extract deep 3D features at multi-scale. The deep 3D features are fused using a 3D FPN module with a 3D RPN head to regress the potential region proposals.}\vspace{-0.2in}
